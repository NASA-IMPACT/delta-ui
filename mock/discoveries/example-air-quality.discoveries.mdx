When governments began implementing shutdowns at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists wondered how the atmosphere would respond to the sudden change in human behavior. With people largely confined to their homes to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, scientists expected there were likely to be fewer cars, planes, and ships burning and emitting fossil fuels. As the pandemic has progressed, these scenarios have largely played out: during the strictest lockdown periods, locations around the world experienced substantial reductions in transportation-related fossil fuel emissions. The impacts on specific air pollutants have been varied and dependant on their lifespan in the atmosphere. Those pollutants with short lifespans, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), decreased dramatically and quickly along with emissions. Today, air quality levels are beginning to approach pre-pandemic levels, and scientists are just beginning to dive into the new measurements collected throughout this unprecedented time.

Cities are easy to spot from space. Choose any large, urban area around the world, and you’re likely to see similar things: dense population centers, complex webs of highways and, more often than not, smog. Smog is the hazy curtain of air that often hangs over cities. It occurs when nitrogen dioxide  produced from fossil fuel emissions from gasoline in cars or coal in powerplants chemically reacts with sunlight and other pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO). Thick smog is harmful to breathe and can significantly reduce visibility. During lockdowns, satellites observed sharp reductions in nitrogen dioxide emissions in cities around the world, and smog began to vanish. Skies were bluer, air was cleaner, and, in some places, views previously obscured by air pollution were suddenly revealed. In Los Angeles, NASA scientists detected that nitrogen dioxide levels fell by more than 30% during the height of COVID-related shutdowns. Other large cities around the world experienced similar reductions.

When Chinese authorities suspended travel and closed businesses in late January 2020 in response to the novel coronavirus, Beijing’s local nitrogen dioxide levels fell dramatically. In February 2020, concentrations fell by nearly 30% compared to the previous five-year average.

Cities across South America experienced similar declines in nitrogen dioxide. Lima, Peru had some of the most substantial reductions, with nitrogen dioxide levels falling approximately 70% below normal levels.
